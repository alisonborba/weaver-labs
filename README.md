# Development Process

### Steps Taken to Build the Application

The development process started with an analysis of the problem statement and the provided `data.json` file. Once I had a clear understanding, I brainstormed potential solutions, creating quick sketches on paper to visualise the structure and flow of the application:

With this initial plan, I set up the project using **Next.js**, as it provides a simple way to combine server-side APIs with React. This choice also made it easier to handle backend requests and state management.

I used **Cursor** as an AI assistant to generate boilerplate code and refine components by giving detailed prompts for each screen. I started by implementing the API layer, ensuring that `data.json` acted as a pseudo-database. My primary focus was to preserve its structure, while making minimal adjustments to make it more database-ready for future use.

The first UI feature I developed was the **Recipes Table**, with basic operations like adding and deleting recipes. Once this feature was stable, I implemented the **Ingredients Table**, adding the ability to manage ingredients inline (without navigating to a separate screen), aiming for a simpler user flow. (`Screenshoot of the page progress in the end of this Doc.`)

To improve navigation, I added a **sidebar** with quick links to the pages. I then worked on **form validations** and **deletion safeguards**, such as preventing the removal of an ingredient currently used by a recipe, and adding confirmation modals before delete actions.

Once all core features were implemented, I conducted a thorough review of the codebase, refactoring and simplifying several AI-generated components to improve readability, maintainability, and overall structure.

After the core features were in place, I moved to **testing**:

- **Unit Tests:** Implemented with **Jest** for key functions and components.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Built with **Playwright**, testing flows such as adding, deleting, and verifying empty states. I also adapted the UI for mobile responsiveness since tables are notoriously difficult to handle on smaller screens.

Finally, I deployed the project to **Vercel**.

# Challenges

### 1. Choosing the Right State Management

Initially, I considered using **Zustand** for state management. However, I concluded that the problem scope was too small to justify it. Instead, I used:

- **React Query (TanStack Query):** for data fetching, caching, and optimistic updates.
- **React Hook Form + Zod:** to handle form state and validation.
- **Local React state:** for lightweight component state where global management wasn‚Äôt needed.

This combination offered simplicity and strong developer experience while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

### 2. Optimistic UI and `data.json` as a Database

Since `data.json` acted as the main data source, I had to ensure updates were immediately reflected in the UI. **React Query‚Äôs built-in cache and invalidation** features allowed me to simulate optimistic updates effectively, reducing unnecessary reloads and ensuring a responsive user experience.

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness

Playwright‚Äôs mobile test runs revealed some UI inconsistencies, especially with layouts. I applied responsive styling to ensure the UI remained usable across devices.

### 4. File-based Data Storage

Vercel doesn't support server-side file writing for JSON storage. Implemented client-side data management with React Query, easily replaceable with a database
